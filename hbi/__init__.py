    HBI is an alternative idiomatic methodology to implement IPC (inter-process communication), it tends to be
    adapting amongst RPC(remote procedure call), Streaming/Pipelining, and PubSub/Notification styles of communication
    at runtime, and typically leverage a single network channel (sockets, pipes, http, websockets, etc.) between two
    peer nodes.
